# PERCY - Personal Emergency Rescue for Commercial Vehicles in Yearly Floods

## About PERCY

PERCY is an innovative disaster management solution designed to address flood emergencies. It's an attachable kit that can be mounted on any commercial car, enabling vehicles to float during severe floods, thus ensuring passenger safety and reducing reliance on emergency services.

Developed by Pranav Verma and Parantap Mishra from Lotus Valley International School, Noida, PERCY aims to provide an accessible, affordable, and adaptable solution for personal vehicles to navigate submerged roads safely.

## The Problem

Floods are one of the most devastating natural disasters, affecting millions of people globally every year:

- In India alone, over 20 million individuals face the dire consequences of flooding annually
- These consequences include loss of life, displacement, and damage to infrastructure
- Climate change is accelerating the frequency and intensity of floods
- Emergency response teams are often overwhelmed, delayed, or unavailable during crises
- There is a lack of accessible solutions for personal vehicles to navigate submerged roads safely

## Our Solution

PERCY is an attachable kit consisting of:
- Air tubes for flotation
- Multiple depth sensors
- High-capacity air pumps

When floodwaters rise above a critical threshold, PERCY activates its flotation mechanism, inflating tubes to provide essential buoyancy and allowing the car to float in critical situations.

### Key Components

1. **Depth Sensors**: Strategically positioned around the vehicle to constantly monitor water levels
2. **Flotation Mechanism**: Tubes that inflate to provide buoyancy
3. **Air Pumps**: High-capacity pumps that quickly inflate the tubes
4. **Manual Deployment**: Ability for the driver to manually deploy the system for redundancy

### Advantages

- **Ensures Safety**: Prevents vehicle submersion, safeguarding passengers
- **Universal Fit**: Compatible with most commercial vehicles
- **Cost-Effective**: Affordable design for widespread accessibility
- **Reduces Dependence**: Minimizes reliance on emergency services
- **Enhanced Mobility**: Optional paddles enable navigation in flooded areas
